In this assignment, we will break a network into pieces. Many empirical networks are hard to break if we randomly attack it. However, by strategically attacking a specific part of the network, we can break it very easily. This leads to the idea of "importance", i.e., a node is "important" for the network if removing the node breaks the network.
